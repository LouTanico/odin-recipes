    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A <em>festive(?)</em> cake that looks like a literal box of cat shit.  Somehow taste worse than it looks.</p>
        <p>We think you will <strong>LOVE</strong> it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>36 ounce caramel flavored cake mix</li>
            <li>6 eggs (or as called for by your cake mix)</li>
            <li>2/3 cup oil (or as called for by your cake mix)</li>
            <li>2 2/3 cups water (or as called for by your cake mixes)</li>
            <li>16 ounce package vanilla cream-filled sandwich style cookies</li>
            <li>6 ounce box chocolate pudding mix</li>
            <li>12-16 small Tootsie Rolls</li>
            <li>1 new <em>(or at least recently cleaned)</em> kitty litter box</li>
            <li>1 plastic Pooper Scooper</li>
            <li>green food coloring</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare cake mixes and bake according to directions on box, using 2 9x13" pans. Let cool completely.</li>
            <li>Prepare pudding mix according to package directions. Once cooked, cover bowl with saran wrap, and chill in refrigerator, until ready to assemble cake.</li>
            <li>Place Vanilla sandwich cookies in a heavy duty Zip-lock plastic bag, and roll with a rolling pin until cookies are crumbled.</li>
            <li>Set aside 1/4 cup of the cookie crumbs. Add a few drops green food coloring to the 1/4 cup crumbs, and mix with a fork.</li>
            <li>Remove the cakes from their pans, and crumble into a lg. bowl.</li>
            <li>Toss cake with 1/2 the remaining vanilla cookie crumbs, and the chilled pudding. You probably won't need all of the pudding.</li>
            <li>Mix gently with the cake crumbs until evenly moist.</li>
            <li>Put mixture into a new or gently used litter box that has been lined with plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>Unwrap the tootsie rolls. Place 3 of them in a microwavable dish, and heat on LOW until soft and pliable, checking every 30 secs. Taper the ends of the tootsie rolls, rolling them between your palms and curving slightly, to make them look like pieces of poop.</li>
            <li>Repeat with remaining tootsie rolls, heating them 3 at a time. Bury some of them and you can place a few on top too. Sprinkle some of the ones on top with cookie crumbs.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the other 1/2 of cookie crumbs over top of the cake.</li>
            <li>Scatter the green cookie crumbs lightly over the top (this resembles the colored granules in some brands of kitty litter).</li>
            <li>Dip the scoop in the box, and your ready to scoop and eat!</li>
        </ol>
